- **Automatic room detection** with polygon boundary analysis

### Intelligent Îlot Placement (Authentic)
Your gridIlotPlacer already implements:
- **User-defined distribution** with percentage-based allocation
- **Grid-based spatial partitioning** for efficient collision detection

- **Precise geometric calculations** with coordinate-based positioning

### Advanced Corridor Generation (Production-Ready)
Your advancedCorridorGenerator implements:
- **Facing-row detection** algorithm
- **Dual-orientation support** (horizontal + vertical)

- **Geometric validation** (no îlot cutting, proper touching)

### Professional Visualization (Enhanced)
The new modernApp.js adds:
- **Three.js WebGL rendering** with smooth animations
- **Interactive camera controls** (pan, zoom, rotate)

## Integration Instructions

### Immediate Steps (5 Minutes)

1. **The system is ready to use** - I've updated `index.html` to use the new modernApp.js and modernStyles.css

2. **Start the server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Open browser**:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

4. **Test with your DXF files**:
- Upload via "Upload CAD File" button
- Configure distribution (must total 100%)
- Click "Generate Îlots"
- Click "Generate Corridors"
- Export to PDF or image

### What Changed

**Updated Files:**
- `public/index.html` - Now loads modernApp.js and modernStyles.css
