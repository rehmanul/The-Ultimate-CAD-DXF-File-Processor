# FloorPlan Pro Clean - TODO List

## Current Task: Fix Corridor Generation Overlapping Issue

- [x] Analyze current corridor generation logic
- [x] Identify issue: grouping by rows (Y-coordinate) creates horizontal corridors
- [x] Fix: Change to group by columns (X-coordinate) for vertical corridors
- [x] Update `groupIlotsByColumns()` method
- [x] Update `generateCorridors()` to create vertical corridors between adjacent ilots in same column
- [x] Use margin parameter to prevent overlap
- [x] Test the changes with sample data
- [x] Update tests to reflect new vertical corridor behavior
- [x] Commit and push changes to repository

## Current Focus: Comprehensive Enhancements
